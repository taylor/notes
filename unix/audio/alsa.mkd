## Switching devices

*NOTE:*

ALSA requires restarting the program to switch device... or I should say unless the program itself supports switching devices you must restart the program.

Create ~/.asoundrc with

```
pcm.!default {
  type plug
  slave.pcm {
    @func getenv
    vars [ ALSAPCM ]
    default "front"
  }
}
```

where default is found from aplay -L or aplay -l

Then to switch use:

```
ALSAPCM='hw:SoundBar' mocp
```

when starting an application
